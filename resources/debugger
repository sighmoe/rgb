Let's write a debugger for our emulator. This debugger will allow us to step one instruction
at a time or provide an integer value of instructions to execute for convienence. It should allow
us to observe values in registers, and given a memory location show the contents at that address.

Ideally everything debugger related should be in its own crate but it can be imported and hooked
into our emulator at the main loop. The debugger should take in an optional flag for it to be ran.

Ideally we will have a seperate gui window for our debugger with buttons to step and a view of registers.
