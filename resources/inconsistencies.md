# Game Boy Instruction Implementation Inconsistencies Report

This report compares the RGB Game Boy emulator's instruction implementations against the canonical Game Boy instructions database (`gb-instructions-db.json`) and identifies potential inconsistencies that may need to be addressed.

## Analysis Summary

**Database**: 500 total instructions covering all Game Boy opcodes (0x00-0xFF) and CB-prefixed instructions (0xCB00-0xCBFF)
**Emulator**: Comprehensive instruction set implementation with modular architecture

## Critical Timing Inconsistencies

### 1. **Cycle Timing Units Mismatch**

**Issue**: The instruction database uses "machine cycles" (M-cycles) while our timing implementation appears to use "T-cycles" in some places.

- **Database Example**: `ADD A,B` (opcode 0x80) shows `"cycles": "1"`
- **Our Implementation**: `instruction_timing.rs` shows complex cycle calculations that don't directly match database values
- **Impact**: All instruction timing may be incorrect by a factor of 4 (1 M-cycle = 4 T-cycles)

**Affected Instructions**: ALL instructions

### 2. **Memory Access Timing**

**Issue**: Memory access instructions may have incorrect cycle counts.

- **Database**: `LD (HL),d8` (opcode 0x36) shows `"cycles": "3"`
- **Our Implementation**: May not account for the extra memory write cycle
- **Database**: `LD A,(BC)` (opcode 0x0A) shows `"cycles": "2"`

### 3. **16-bit Arithmetic Timing**

**Issue**: 16-bit ADD instructions timing mismatch.

- **Database**: `ADD HL,BC` likely shows 2 M-cycles
- **Our Implementation**: May be using incorrect timing in `instruction_timing.rs`

## Flag Handling Inconsistencies

### 1. **Flag Notation Interpretation**

**Issue**: Database uses specific flag notation that may not match our implementation.

- **Database Example**: For `ADD A,B` - `"flags": { "CY": "8-bit", "H": "8-bit", "N": "0", "Z": "Z" }`
- **Meaning**: 
  - `"CY": "8-bit"` = Carry flag set on 8-bit overflow
  - `"H": "8-bit"` = Half-carry flag set on bit 3 overflow  
  - `"N": "0"` = Subtract flag always cleared
  - `"Z": "Z"` = Zero flag set if result is zero

**Our Implementation**: Need to verify flag setting logic in `arithmetic.rs` execution matches these exact semantics.

### 2. **BIT Instruction Flags**

**Issue**: BIT instructions have specific flag behavior.

- **Database**: `BIT 0,A` (opcode CB47) shows `"flags": { "H": "1", "N": "0", "Z": "!r0" }`
- **Meaning**: H=1 (always set), N=0 (always cleared), Z=NOT(bit value)
- **Our Implementation**: Verify `bit_operations.rs` execution sets flags correctly

## CB-Prefixed Instructions

### 1. **Opcode Format**

**Issue**: Database represents CB instructions as 4-character hex (e.g., "CB47") while our implementation may handle them differently.

- **Database**: All CB instructions show 2 bytes and specific opcodes like "CB47", "CB40", etc.
- **Our Implementation**: Need to verify CB instruction decoding in `bit_operations.rs` handles the full CB+opcode correctly

### 2. **CB Instruction Timing**

**Issue**: All CB instructions in database show `"cycles": "2"` which may not match our implementation.

## Memory Addressing Inconsistencies

### 1. **High RAM Access (LDH)**

**Issue**: LDH instructions have specific timing and addressing behavior.

- **Database**: `LDH A,(a8)` (opcode F0) shows `"cycles": "3"` and specific 0xFF00+ addressing
- **Our Implementation**: Verify I/O operations in `memory.rs` handle 0xFF00+ addressing correctly

### 2. **Indirect Memory Access**

**Issue**: Memory access through register pairs may have incorrect timing.

- **Database**: Various `LD (HL),r` and `LD r,(HL)` instructions show specific cycle counts
- **Our Implementation**: Verify memory access timing in data transfer execution

## Missing or Incomplete Instructions

### 1. **Special Instructions**

**Potential Issues**:
- `DAA` (Decimal Adjust Accumulator) - Complex flag behavior
- `HALT` bug behavior - May not be fully implemented according to hardware quirks
- `STOP` instruction - May be incomplete
- Interrupt timing edge cases

### 2. **Stack Operations**

**Issue**: Stack operation timing verification needed.

- **Database**: `PUSH BC` type instructions have specific cycle counts
- **Our Implementation**: Verify stack operations timing in `stack_operations.rs`

## Architecture-Specific Issues

### 1. **Conditional Instruction Timing**

**Issue**: Conditional jumps/calls have branch-taken vs not-taken timing differences.

- **Database**: May specify different cycle counts for taken vs not-taken branches
- **Our Implementation**: `instruction_timing.rs` handles this but needs verification against database

### 2. **Memory Bank Controller Effects**

**Issue**: Some instructions may behave differently when accessing MBC registers.

- **Database**: Standard instruction behavior
- **Our Implementation**: Need to verify MBC write instructions don't affect normal instruction timing

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Timing Units**: Clarify whether database uses M-cycles or T-cycles and adjust accordingly
2. **Verify ADD Instruction Flags**: Ensure arithmetic flag setting matches database exactly
3. **Check CB Instruction Implementation**: Verify all 256 CB instructions are correctly implemented

### Medium Priority  
1. **Memory Access Timing**: Audit all memory access instructions for correct cycle counts
2. **Flag Setting Verification**: Systematic verification of flag behavior for all instruction categories
3. **LDH Instruction Testing**: Verify high RAM access instructions work correctly

### Low Priority
1. **Edge Case Testing**: HALT bug, STOP behavior, interrupt timing edge cases
2. **Performance Optimization**: Once correctness is verified, optimize timing implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Instruction Test Suite**: Test each opcode category against known good implementations
2. **Timing Test ROMs**: Use Blargg's test ROMs and other timing-sensitive test programs
3. **Flag Behavior Tests**: Specific tests for flag setting behavior in arithmetic operations
4. **CB Instruction Tests**: Comprehensive testing of all bit manipulation instructions

## Notes

- The database appears to be authoritative and well-structured
- Our implementation is comprehensive but needs verification against the canonical behavior
- Most inconsistencies are likely in timing and flag handling rather than missing functionality
- The modular architecture of our implementation makes it easier to fix specific instruction categories
